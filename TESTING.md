## Introduction

In my testing I developed a comprehensive testing plan to make sure that the site was functioning correctly. I used manual testing and automated validation to test the site. The site was tested throughout the process, both in the development and deployed version of the sites. All the test results detailed below are based on the [deployed site](https://emmahewson.github.io/mp2_travel_quiz/).

All information about any bugs encountered that were fixed or remain in the site can be found in the [README - Bugs & Fixes section](README.md/#bugs--fixes).

## Validation

### HTML Validation

I ran the code for all the pages through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). All pages passed the validation tests. For full results see the dropdowns below.

<details><summary>HTML Validation Results Screenshot</summary>

<img src="">

_Due to the site having user authentication & log in as well as using Jinja templating to build the page I had to test the HTML using the validator's text-input. Therefore all the results images look identical. Above is a sample of what all the results looked like._

### CSS Validation

I ran the CSS code through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). All code passed the validation tests. For full results see the dropdowns below.

### JavaScript Linting

I ran the JavaScript code through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/). There were some minor errors & warnings which are detailed in the notes below. Based on the research done in to these errors, and the fact that they are mostly due to errors on the part of the validator or external code over which I have no control I have accepted them and marked the tests as passed for the purposes and scope of this project. For full results see the dropdowns below.

### Python Linting

I ran the app.py code through [https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html](https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html) to check the Syntax. Code Anywhere also has a built in Python Linter which was used throughout the development process. All code passed the validation tests. For full results see the dropdowns below.

### Accessibility

I ran the site through the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). There were some minor errors & warnings which I was unable to rectify which are detailed in the notes below. Based on the research done in to these errors, and the fact that they are mostly due to errors on the part of the validator or external code over which I have no control I have accepted them and marked the tests as passed for the purposes and scope of this project. For full results see the dropdowns below.

<details><summary>Notes on Accessibility Results</summary>

There were a number of errors and warnings highlighted by the validation process. Many of these I was able to fix and the details of those are in the table. However a number of these were issues stemming from either Materialize or from Google Maps API which I have been unable to remedy as these are external resources. There were also a couple of recurring warnings which I was able to safely disregard.

__Recurring Warnings__

Wave threw up a couple of minor warnings on every page which linked to to the nav & the footer:
- Underlined Text: the email link in the footer threw up a warning that underlined text indicated a link, however as this text was in fact a link no warning was necessary and I disregarded it.
- Redundant Link: a warning about 2 adjacent items in the nav link going to the same place, in this case the logo and the first nav item, as this was my intention I disregarded this warning.


__Google Map Errors/Warnings__

Google Maps threw up a number of errors and warnings in the accessibility checks. These were:
- Error - Image map area missing alternative text:
    - I researched what was causing this and it is a consistent error on Google Maps that has no known fix that wouldn't in fact make the map less accessible. Because of this I have left the site as it is and the accessibility flagged error remains. More information here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59326196/google-map-missing-alt-of-image-causing-lower-accessibility
- Warnings - various, including orphaned form label, very small text, redundant title text, layout table
    - I am unable to make any changes to counteract these warnings as they all relate to Google Maps' own styling and layout and as they are only warnings and not errors I have left the map as it is.

__Error: Label for Dropdown Menu on Forms__

On the forms containing dropdown menus Wave threw up an error about there not being an associated label for the input. However I had included a label with a matching 'for' attribute. Looking in to this problem further I discovered that the issue was caused by the Materialize JavaScript code creating a new input element when it populated the dropdown. Unfortunately in order to fix this I would have to re-write the entire code for the dropdown from scratch and so I was unable to fix this error. [See Bug 13 - No label for select dropdown menus on forms - Links to README](README.md/#13-accessibility---no-label-for-select-dropdown-menus-on-forms)

__Datepicker Tab Index__

The Materialize Datepicker has a tab index which threw a warning on Wave. However as this was a warning and not an error I decided to leave it as it was rather than trying to rebuild the whole Datepicker.

### Performance

I ran the site through Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to check on its performance scores. All pages passed the validation tests. For full results see the dropdowns below.

The only additional thing of note was that the console threw some warnings about passive event listeners from the materialize.min.js file. This was related to event listeners not being set to passive, but as it was referring to code that I had not written myself and being reluctant to change the Materialize code incase it caused other errors I didn't want to pursue this warning further, especially as the site didn't technically fail the console tests as it was only a warning and not an error.

## User Stories Testing

The site was built from the outset with user stories at its core. The site was tested against each of the user stories, running through the steps a user would take to achieve their goal. The results can be found below.
